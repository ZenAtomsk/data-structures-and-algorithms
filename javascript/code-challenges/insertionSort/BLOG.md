# Insertion Sort

## Process

The iteration starts at the second element. The first element is sorted by default. For each iteration, the current value is kept track of. each current element will be the first element of the unsorted array and each before it, will be part of the sorted array.

Through a while loop, go through the sorted array and shift elements, opening a space for current element to be inserted.

Once the correct placement is found, the current element is inserted into the newly-opened spot. Repeat until array is sorted.
