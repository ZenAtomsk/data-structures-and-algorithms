# Linked-list

Resolved by Ricardo Barcenas

## Challenge

Create a class that will allow creation of new nodes, search for matching contents and a string of the generated list.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API

insert() - Inserts new node at beginning of linked list making whichever value that was added last, the head and pointing to the value that was previously head.

includes() - Checks to see if a value exists within the linked list and returns either true or false.

toString() - Returns the elements found in a linked list as a string.

## Solution

- [Linked List](linked-list.js)
